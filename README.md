# CV Application
CV-APP takes in information and turns it into a minimal resume with standard dimensions. The resume formatting is a culmination of popular resume formats seen on a computer science [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/) & Google Images. The current goal is to add the ablity to export a text scanned document.

This app was an exercise described by [The Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application) to get familiar with react methods and objects. 

Current Development - Working on converting React JSX code to @react-pdf/renderer object code so a PDF can be generated. Sadly, there does not exist a direct React Compoment to PDF generation. I will have to transpile all visual react compoments into @react-pdf/renderer compatible components.
