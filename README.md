# CV Application
CV-APP takes in information and turns it into a minimal resume with standard dimensions. The resume formatting is a culmination of popular resume formats seen on a computer science [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/) & Google Images. The current goal is to add the ablity to export a text scanned document.
